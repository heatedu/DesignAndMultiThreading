StrategyDesignPrinciple:
############################
1.)Strategy defines a family of algoriths,encapsulates each one,and make them interchangable.Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from client that use it.
2.)Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them,so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those who dont.
3.)Program to interface and not to implimentation.
4.)Favour Composition over Inheritance
